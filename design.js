        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p >Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.[4] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam,
             Andhra Pradesh.[5] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was 
             raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, 
             who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[6] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[7]
             Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp,
             Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. 
             So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[7] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could 
             bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled 
             in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, "scoring a century on debut as an opener".[8]</p>
